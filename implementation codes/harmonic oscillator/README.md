When using measurement outcomes as the input, the network receives a large number of input values and it is deeper and much harder to train. As a result, the reinforcement learning process is not as stable as other cases, and it only works well with moderate hyperparameter settings. Our results are generated by the following training command.
```python main_parallel.py --input wavefunction --phonon_cutoff 10 --reward_scale_up 1.```
